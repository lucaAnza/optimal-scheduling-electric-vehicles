# optimal-scheduling-electric-vehicles
This project implements an optimization framework for smart charging and discharging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in a microgrid environment. It includes both global (offline) and local (real-time MPC) scheduling strategies, supporting V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) and CHG-only modes.
